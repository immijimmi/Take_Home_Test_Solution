- Amounts are not calculated with the same degree of rigour that would be required if this app were creating
  transactions rather than just displaying existing ones
- Values used for indexing or matching the returned API data are not organised into enums,
  since the way that the API organises its data is not known and therefore cannot be imitated
- Mobile-first design is not implemented in areas that would cause a conflict with component-specific styles
